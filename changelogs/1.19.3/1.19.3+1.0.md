# Updated to 1.19.3

## New & improved Telemetry Fix

New telemetry menu in 1.19.3 allows you to set telemetry from Minimal to Full, Debugify adds a third option,
off, that fully turns off and prevents Minecraft from connecting to Mojang telemetry services.

This also allows for a tooltip explaining each type of telemetry option.

### Technical Details

Debugify adds another option in `options.txt` named `debugifyTelemetry` where
0 = off, 1 = minimal and 2 = full. Debugify internally sets the vanilla option
to minimal if off or minimal so if you delete Debugify you would not be defaulted
to full.

## Options GUI improvements

You can now search for fixes using their descriptions as well as their bug ID.

'Server' fixes have been renamed to 'Main' fixes because previous wording was misleading
that they only applied on a server.

'Main' and 'Client' are now categories instead of groups while 'Basic' and 'Gameplay' have
taken their place as groups rather than categories. The gameplay warning and multiplayer toggle
are mirrored in both categories.

Fix groups are now expanded by default.

## New versioning system

Due to how intertwined Debugify is with Minecraft versions, starting 1.19.3, a new versioning
system for Debugify is being adopted. The version will reset on every Minecraft version bump, including
patches. An example version is `1.19.3+1.0`, the major version will change when Debugify adds new fixes or
any significant changes to the mod itself happens, the minor version will change if Debugify makes any small
changes such as a bug fix or a text localisation update.

This has been made because the current system was very confusing and wasn't clear
when there should ever be a major bump.
